The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored. We will walk through various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this. We will provide comments and insights along the way to give you a sense of how we arrive at each discovery and what next steps it leads to.\n",

Since this class isn't really about the nuances of the Python file system libraries, we've provided a function for you in ds100_utils.py called `fetch_and_cache` that can download files from the internet.\n",

One approach is to use the `fillna` method of the series, which will replace all null (a.k.a. NaN) values with a string of our choosing. In the example below, we picked \"?????\". When you run the code below, you should see that there are 240 businesses with missing zip code."

The benefits of performing cluster sampling over stratified sampling is that with cluster sampling it is much easier to collect data, since not all ZIP codes will necessarily be in the clusters.
